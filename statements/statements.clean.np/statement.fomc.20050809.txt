   the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 12 percent  the committee believes that even after this action the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity  aggregate spending despite high energy prices appears to have strengthened since late winter and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually  core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer term inflation expectations remain well contained but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated  the committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal  with underlying inflation expected to be contained the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured  nonetheless the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability
