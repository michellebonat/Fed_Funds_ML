       the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1 34 percent  the committee believes that even after this action the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity  after moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices output growth appears to have regained some traction and labor market conditions have improved modestly  despite the rise in energy prices inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months    the committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal  with underlying inflation expected to be relatively low the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured  nonetheless the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability
