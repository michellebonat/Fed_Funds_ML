   the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent   the committee believes that even after this action the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity  recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices  labor market conditions however apparently continue to improve gradually  pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident  longer term inflation expectations remain well contained  the committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal  with underlying inflation expected to be contained the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured  nonetheless the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability
