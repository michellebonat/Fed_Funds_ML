      the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for     the federal funds rate at 1 percent     the committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary     policy coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing     important ongoing support to economic activity the evidence accumulated     over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly      and the labor market appears to be improving modestly increases in core     consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low  the committee perceives     that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth     for the next few quarters are roughly equal the probability of an unwelcome     fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost     equal to that of a rise in inflation however with inflation quite low     and resource use slack the committee believes that policy accommodation     can be maintained for a considerable period
