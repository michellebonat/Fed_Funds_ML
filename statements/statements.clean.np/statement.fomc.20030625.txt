      the federal open market committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1 percent  in a related action the board of governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 2 percent  the committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity is providing important ongoing support to economic activity  recent signs point to a firming in spending markedly improved financial conditions and labor and product markets that are stabilizing  the economy nonetheless has yet to exhibit sustainable growth  with inflationary expectations subdued the committee judged that a slightly more expansive monetary policy would add further support for an economy which it expects to improve over time  the committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal  in contrast the probability though minor of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level  on balance the committee believes that the latter concern is likely to predominate for the foreseeable future
