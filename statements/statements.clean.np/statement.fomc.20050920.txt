   the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 34 percent   output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of hurricane katrina  the widespread devastation in the gulf region the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending production and employment will be set back in the near term  in addition to elevating premiums for some energy products the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility   while these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near term economic performance it is the committees view that they do not pose a more persistent threat  rather monetary policy accommodation coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity  higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures  however core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer term inflation expectations remain contained   the committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal  with underlying inflation expected to be contained the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured  nonetheless the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability
