  the federal open market committee decided today to raise its target for     the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 percent     elevated energy prices and hurricane related disruptions in economic     activity have temporarily depressed output and employment however monetary     policy accommodation coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity      is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be     augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane affected areas the cumulative     rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation     pressures however core inflation has been relatively low in recent months     and longer term inflation expectations remain contained     the committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action      the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth     and price stability should be kept roughly equal with underlying inflation     expected to be contained the committee believes that policy accommodation     can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured nonetheless the     committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill     its obligation to maintain price stability
