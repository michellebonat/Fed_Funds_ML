        the federal open market committee today voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 12 percent  in a related action the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5 percent  although cost pressures appear generally contained risks to sustainable growth persist despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economys growth potential  as a consequence the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue  todays increase in the federal funds rate together with the policy actions in june and august and the firming of conditions more generally in unitedstates financial markets over the course of the year should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward  as a consequence the directive the federal open market committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term
